## My process

### Built with

- HTML and CSS


### What I learned

I discovered that even just html and CSS, you can develop a pretty attractive front-end design.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 0 20px 10px 5px #dddede;
}
```


### Continued development

I'd like to learn more CSS code that is brief but has a significant impact on front-end design.


### Useful resources

- Box-shadow(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me in achieving the required shadow appearance
